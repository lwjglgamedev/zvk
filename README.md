# Vulkan graphics programming in Zig

> [!NOTE]
> WORK IN PROGRESS. First chapters available


This [online book](bookcontents/) will introduce the main concepts required to write graphics games or any other applications using [Vulkan](https://www.khronos.org/vulkan/) in [Zig](https://ziglang.org).

This book is the result of my self learning language, that I think it may help the community.

> [!NOTE]
> This is a new version which tries to use modern Vulkan features, such us:
> - Dynamic rendering
> - BDA
> - Ray tracing
> - New Vulkan functions (1.3)
> - ...
>
> Therefore, Vulkan 1.3 is required.
